        <h2>Missile Man of India </h2>
        <p>
          <b>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen (APJ) Abdul Kalam</b> (1931-2015) was an eminent Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile development, Kalam was born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His early life was marked by hardship, but he was determined to pursue education, earning a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology.

Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he played a key role in developing the SLV-III, India's first satellite launch vehicle. He also led the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program, contributing to the development of missiles like Agni and Prithvi.

Kalam's presidency was noted for its focus on education, youth empowerment, and scientific development. He was a recipient of numerous awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. An inspirational figure, Kalam authored several books, including "Wings of Fire" and "Ignited Minds," which continue to motivate millions. His life and work remain a testament to his vision of a developed and self-reliant India.
